## Features

1. **Dataset Upload**
   - **Supported Formats**: Upload datasets in CSV or Excel (.xlsx) format for easy access and compatibility.
   - **File Size Limit**: Supports large datasets up to 200MB for comprehensive analysis.

2. **Data Exploration**
   - **Statistical Summary**: View key statistics like count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and percentiles for numerical columns.
   - **Top and Bottom Rows**: Quickly inspect the first and last few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
   - **Data Types**: Identify data types for each column to understand the datasetâ€™s composition.
   - **Column List**: Access a full list of all columns in the dataset for easy data exploration.

3. **Count Column Values**
   - **Frequency Count**: Get a count of unique values in any column to understand distribution patterns within the dataset.

4. **Group By and Aggregation**
   - **Group By Columns**: Group data by one or more columns to explore specific categories or subsets.
   - **Aggregation Functions**: Perform aggregations like `count`, `sum`, `mean`, `min`, and `max` to derive insights from grouped data.

5. **Data Visualization with Plotly**
   - **Interactive Charts**: Generate a variety of interactive charts powered by Plotly to visualize data:
     - **Bar Chart**: Compare quantities across different categories.
     - **Pie Chart**: Show proportions and percentage breakdowns.
     - **Line Chart**: Track changes over time or continuous data.
     - **Scatter Plot**: Visualize relationships between two variables.
     - **Sunburst Chart**: Represent hierarchical data for a detailed breakdown of nested categories.

These features allow for easy data exploration, analysis, and visualization without requiring complex coding skills.
